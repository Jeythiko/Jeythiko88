        How do i identify hacker and scammer?
        <span class="arrow">➤</span>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Hackers can not be easily identified, they use their own private IP Address, DNS, and strong encription, but you can try to identify them. 
                I will list down several ways to identify the hackers</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Unkown message/email coming from unknown location and try to ask for converstion: </h4>
                <p>You can not just ignore the message/email, response them no matter, but after your converstion goes deeply, they can ask you for your basic
                 details, such as password, username and stuffs.that is where you can begin to realize that the sender is not normal person who just need your 
                 conversation, when it happen like that ignore it you will be soon hunted.
                </p><br>
                <h4>State Sponsored group targeting organizations in other countries:</h4>
                <p>A state-sponsored group is a government-funded hacking organization (APT) that targets foreign institutions to conduct espionage, sabotage, 
                or cyber warfare. Governments use these groups to: Steal sensitive information (espionage), Disrupt enemy systems, 
                Influence politics (cyber warfare), Gain economic advantage, Attack rival nations secretly.
                <p>You need to know this kind of group maybe you may get a chance to protect your own nation from this kinda hacking group.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Hacker group that target companies to make them pay ransom:</h4>
              <p>These are the groups that hack and break down the companies’s system and later force the companies to pay the ransome(money) in the form of 
                cryptocurrency to realease the system. Such kind of attack heavily take place now aday.</p>
                <br>
              <h4> Scammers in disguise of schalarship funding:</h4>
              <p>Hackers/scammers make their way easy to get people’s belonging in many ways, they develop many platform that deceive people in the form of schalarship,
                 after application, they ask for payment to continue education aboard or online, as big percentage of the world is in need of education and traveling 
                 aboard, they capture people’s attention this way, when individuals pay up for schalarship tuitions, they disappear.</p>
                 <br>
              <h4>Hackers/Scammers in the uniform of Humaniterian promotion:</h4>
              <p>Hackers attack individual in the the form of humaniterian promotion, they invoke certain individual claiming that certain individual win something great 
                such as money, properties, or traveling form , after individual’s confirmation, they require funds to secure the promotion, when individual agree to pay 
                something up to receive his/her promised money, immediately they commence to disappear. You can identify them this way.</p>
                <br>
            <h4>Hacker sending malicious link through social media platforms:</h4>
            <p>Hackers send malicious link that require individual to click and deceieve individuals that they’re gonna get suitable resources after visiting, when 
            certain individuals agree, the link can either damage their devices such as computers, mobile phones or loss their accounts permanently and they can not get
             such hacker for life. Take care what link and whom you trust on social media.</p>
             <br>
             <h4>Social media gangs related hackers:</h4>
             <p>One and the most important thing i want my people to know is : internet came with negative and positive impacts, negatively internet offers vast
             negative challenges, hackers develop business platform which enable innocent internet users to invest and gain funds with low cost, at fist session, 
             individual gain funds , happily, they invest in large number and with large amount of money thinking they will be able to recieve another huge amount of 
             funds in return, yet the frauder companies fail to give back the money to investors. They appear in image of well known and legal companies, such as Amazon, 
             Alibaba and many more to steal people’s trust then people invest without single doubt.  To be honest nothing is gurranted(free) in this world, everything 
             cost, if something free come your way on internet, walk away, unless you’re sure about what you’re doing.</p>
